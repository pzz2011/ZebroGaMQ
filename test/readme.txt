Demonstration
=============

Here is the scenario for a demonstration that includes:
- a JavaScript application
- an Android application
- an iOS application


1/ Setting IP addresses
-----------------------

In the following, we explain how to set the IP addresses that you will use for:
- the Python-server,
- the JavaScript-proxy for Web applications,
- the Android-application.

You cannot use the default localhost address because of the Android application.

Here are the configuration files you need to update:
- resources/rabbitmq.properties & resources/xmlrpc.properties
- Android-application/res/raw/rabbitmq.properties & 
  Android-application/res/raw/xmlrpc.properties.
- ios-application/ios-application/resources/rabbitmq.properties & 
  ios-application/ios-application/resources/xmlrpc.properties.

2/ Starting the demonstration
-----------------------------

2.1 Start the server side by launching the following command in a first shell:
    $ ./javascript-integration-test.sh

    This will start:
    - the RabbitMQ broker
    - the GameServer
    - the NodeJsProxy

    The following text will be displayed once the JavaScript-proxy would be started:
    
    "Instructions for the sequel of the demonstration:
    1/ Start a first JavaScript application on your Web browser, and create an instance
    2/ Start a second JavaScript application on your Web browser, and join the instance
    3/ (Optional) Start the Android-application on an Android Device,
    press the menu button, and click on "Join Instance".

    Finally, to properly stop the demonstration,
    echo "execute the termination.sh script located in the current directory."


2.2 Launch the Web application

    Open a Web browser, and go to the following URL:
    http:JAVASCRIPT_PROXY_HOST//:8001/JavaScript-application (where JAVASCRIPT is the address 
    that you have just set in resources/xmlrpc.properties).
    Then, click on the button "Create and join game instance".
    The application will log in, create a game instance, and join that game
    instance.

    Be careful! We do not allow for several Master applications in this
                demonstration.


2.3 Launch the Android application for the player

    Android-application is an Eclipse project. You need to start Eclipse,
    import this project, and run it (whether on an Android device or on an 
    emulator) as an Android Application.
    Press the menu button, and click on "Join Instance".

2.4 Launch the iOS application for the player

    ios-application is a Xcode project. You need to open the project file 
    ios-application/ios-application.xcodeproj
    by Xcode, and run it (whether on an iOS device or on an 
    emulator) as an iOS Application.
    Click on "Join Instance".

2.5 Messages exchanged

    The JavaScript and the Android application should have logged in and and 
    should have joined the game instance. They will periodically send 
    heartbeat messages and messages to ask the game logic server for the list 
    of participants.

3/ Terminating the demonstration
--------------------------------

Terminate the demonstration on both server and clients side by launching the 
following command in a second shell:
$ ./termination.sh
