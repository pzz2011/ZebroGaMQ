[ZebroGaMQ: Communication Middleware for Mobile Gaming](http://www.totem-games.org/?q=Communication%20Middleware)
================================

ZebroGaMQ provides an easy and reliable way to 
publish and consume messages in the context of mobile multiplayer games. 
A prototypical game involves:

* A Python server
* Android applications
* JavaScript applications
* Java J2SE applications
* C++ applications
* iOS applications

Here are the most powerful features of the middleware:

* Clients of ZebroGaMQ don’t have to handle the low-level details of reception
  of messages, they just need to define a behaviour on the consumption of these messages.
* Disconnection management of Android devices: you just have to focus on publishing your 
  messages, the middleware handles for you the loss of network connection inherent 
  to mobile networks.
* Game instances management: you can create several instances of your game, and let players
  use those instances in parallel.

ZebroGaMQ is presented with a demonstrator game called [aMazing](http://www.totem-games.org/?q=aMazing),
a geolocalized multiplayer game for Android devices.
